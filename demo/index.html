        <p>We designed and developed our exclusive line of stainless-steel kitchen tools by drawing upon more than fifty years of culinary experience. These professional-quality utensils are crafted of heavy-gauge stainless steel and ergonomically shaped for excellent balance and controlâ€”for a difference you can really feel in the hand. We created this spoon with a very deep bowl, so it essentially functions like a ladle for scooping and serving. And with a gleaming polished finish, it's an attractive choice for serving at the table.</p>
